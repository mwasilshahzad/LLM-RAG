The aim here was to build a system that utalize the power of LLM Chat GPT-2 Model tuned according to our data. For that I created below:
1) Embeddings of PDF
2) Stored them to Qdrant (an open source vector DB)
3) Score calculate Testing with prompt embeddings and DB Vector embeddings and comparision amongst them
4) Used BERT base model to generate the response at the end.
